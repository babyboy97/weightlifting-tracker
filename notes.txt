Add person level data tracking, unique identifier for different people. Created date, username, password, email

Make assumptions on rest day when nothign is logged? Requires you to be able to go back and update and to chose yourself 
when adding data points. Potentially at beginning of session you chose your person from drop down? With a password to
retain adding data to other profiles. If so, need to blacklist the funciton from the query_data function for front facing 
users or code native users.

chose a drop down exercise then provide 5 set slots so you dont have to enter each set individually

[Future] Create way to see my progress or historical data. Integrate powerBI type data, or create a dashboard.

Add a cardio section. Consider adding an exercise relation table with minutes and calories burned. If they do not know 
the calories burned consider making a simple calculator. Will be poor but its not the worst if you can ball park it. 

track your friends, make communities.
