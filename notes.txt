Add person level data tracking, unique identifier for different people 

Make assumptions on rest day when nothign is logged? Requires you to be able to go back and update and to chose yourself 
when adding data points. Potentially at beginning of session you chose your person from drop down? With a password to
retain adding data to other profiles. If so, need to blacklist the funciton from the query_data function for front facing 
users or code native users.

chose a drop down exercise then provide 5 set slots so you dont have to enter each set individually
